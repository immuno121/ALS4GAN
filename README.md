### Abstract
Remote sensing data is crucial for applications ranging from monitoring forest fires and deforestation to tracking urbanization. Most of these tasks require dense pixel-level annotations for the model to parse visual information from limited labeled data available for these satellite images. Due to the dearth of high-quality labeled training data in this domain, recent advances have focused on semi-supervised techniques. These techniques generate pseudo-labels from a small set of labeled examples which are used to augment the labeled training set. This makes it necessary to have a highly representative and diverse labeled training set. Therefore, we propose to use an active learning-based sampling strategy to select a highly representative set of labeled training data. We demonstrate our proposed method's effectiveness on two existing semantic segmentation datasets containing satellite images: UC Merced Land Use Classification Dataset, and DeepGlobe Land Cover Classification Dataset. We report a 27% improvement in mIoU with as little as 2% labeled data using active learning sampling strategies over randomly sampling the small set of labeled training data.

## Training and Testing

**Training the Active Learner**  

  ```
  python tools/train_AL.py --dataset-name <DATASET_NAME>   
                           --query-strategy <QUERY_STRATEGY> 
                           --random-scale 
                           --random-mirror 
                           --data-dir <DATA_DIR>
                           --data-list <DATA_LIST> 
                           --labeled-ratio <LABELED_RATIO>
                           --model-name <MODEL_NAME>
                           --num-classes <NUM_CLASSES>
                           --learning-rate 0.001 
                           --num-epochs 50 
                           --alpha <ALPHA>
                           --beta <BETA>
```

Here is an explanation of the important parameters:
- `dataset-name`: Can be one of `UCM` or `deepglobe` or a custom dataset
- `query-strategy`: Should be one of `entropy` or `margin`
- `data-dir`: Parent directory of the dataset
- `data-list`: Path to the text file containing the file names of the training dataset
- `labeled-ratio`: Labeled ratio (value between 0 and 1, Eg: 0.05 = 5% labeled ratio)
-  `model-name`: Image classification network (Can be one of `res50` or `res101` or another image classification network)
-  `num-classes`: Number of classes in the image classification network
-  `alpha`: A value between 0 and 1 (refer the paper for details)
-  `beta`: A value between 0 and 1 (refer the paper for details)

Training the active learner would output a `.npy` with the image names of the top-k most diverse samples selected by the query strategy. 

  
**Training the S4GAN Model**  
```
python tools/train_s4gan.py --dataset <DATASET_NAME> 
                            --labeled-ratio <LABELED_RATIO>
                            --threshold-st <SELF_TRAINING_THRESHOLD>
                            --num-classes <NUM_CLASSES>
                            --data-dir <DATA_DIR>
                            --data-list <TRAIN_DATA_LIST>
                            --batch-size 10 
                            --num-steps 20000 
                            --restore-from <PRETRAINED_BACKBONE_WEIGHTS_PATH> 
                            --save-pred-every 100 
                            --random-seed <RANDOM_SEED> 
                            --active-learning 
                            --active-learning-images-array <OUTPUT OF train_al.py>
```
